$ npm run test test/routes/entities.test.js

# run mocha tests for a specific folder
$ npm run test test/routes/

## Running linter

To run the linter using the npm run lint command you have to specify at least the directory you want linter to run.

To specify the directory and any additional arguments you need to add -- (double dash) before the arguments you want to pass, e.g.

```sh
# run lint in the current directory
$ npm run lint -- .

# run lint in the routes directory and fix all issues
$ npm run lint -- ./routes/ --fix
```
